# EC-500-Project
Deep Learning Course Project
We need to have .gitignore here
I implemented a simple GAN and ipynb file has its loss, and sample images in each 10 iterations. I also saved the final model.
We can restore and generate more images. It starts with a random noise and kinda learns some shapes.
